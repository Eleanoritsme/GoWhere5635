# GoWhere

This is a software that helps users shrink the time of making desicions about choosing the place before going out for an activity such as eating out, studying and working.

## Description

Users will first go through the filtering processes (e.g. select an activity, customise the expected time, estimated range of location, and expected price). After these steps, our algorithm will give users some suitable recommendations for them to choose, in which help them escape from choosing for a place from uncountable choices.
